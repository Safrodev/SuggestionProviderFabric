# SuggestionProviderFabric

A minor change to Minecraft's suggestion provider so that it auto-completes resource locations for all mod namespaces.

Whilst this is a very tiny change, if you use commands a lot in modded it is likely to save you a lot of time.

Note that this mod does not need to be installed on a dedicated server to work, though doing so is advisable so that the client and server mod list match.
